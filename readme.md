# Advanced React Class Work - Wes Bos Curriculum 

## Data Analyst, What Are You Doing?

You're right. This doesn't seem intuitive for one certified as a data analyst. Shouldn't I be graphing something? 

Perhaps learning React and stepping back into JavaScript would make less sense if there was not a fraternal connection between data analysis, statistical learning, and user experience. I had stepped aside from JavaScript and design in exchange for what I thought was a nobler persuit. But as I progressed through the Data Analysis and Visualization Boot Camp at UT Austin, I realized all the data in the world, flawlessly cleaned, joined without fault, transformed correctly on the first try, and queried perfectly is all for naught if it cannot be visualized.


## Designers Gonna Design Stuff

I would be hardpressed to stare one directly in the face and say truthfully that I am pre-disposed to data science. Learning Statistics is difficult without formal education. I gave up on mathematics in sixth grade. Even in college I did just enough learning to graduate with the barest minimum of linear algebra. During the boot camp at UT, I fell into a designer's role during project work, unable to stretch my legs with data ETL while my skills at design were badly needed to deliver a usable dashboard. 

I've spent the last three and a half months clinging to python for dear life. R feels like a blasphemous betrayal (despite being just as good for data analysis). MySQL feels like a lifetime ago. All the full-stack tools I gained at the boot camp are hazy, but still presient. Of the many gaps in my education that are meant to be filled in with continued learning, JavaScript, particularly D3, is one of the largest gaps. It was the most difficult to grasp, more difficult than MySQL, and perhaps the most useful for designing readable, scalable, re-usable, interactive, and responsive visualizations. 

So here we are, stepping back on the path towards design, remembering that all learning is good learning, that learning JavaScript won't make me forget python, and remembering that every job has a toolbox, and that the next steps will call upon skills I fear losing. 


## Why A Fresh Repository? Why Not Fork Wes Bos?

In addition to the React course, I'm reacquainting myself with the Git cli. This reacquaintaince has taken me back to the beginning of my journey through Git to gain more confidence with the DVCS and correct many of the issues I've had using the platform in the past. In addition to the need to practice my Git cli skills, I have nothing to add to the Wes Bos curriculum. There was no need to fork the repository, since there would be no merge request. I chose to clone down a copy Wes Bos's repository, make a copy of it on my local machine, initiate a fresh repository, and push it upstream to a new remote. 

You can imagine how quick I was to excericese those Git muscles, and you can therefore imagine how quickly I dropped the dumbbells on my feet. I never initiate a repository correctly on the first try. Thank goodness that Git is more than forgiving to me. What you see here is the source and starter code for the Advanced React class from Wes Bos. All credit goes to the author of the content. I purchased the class on my own. I am not affiliated with the course or its content aside from my role as a student. 


## What Will I Gain From This Class?

I hope to not only reconnect with JavaScript, but to also familiarize myself with the section of data analysis that departs from python and R and focuses on the design of dashboard and experience. I stand to gain experience with tools and best practices necessary for the advancment of my career in contemporary web platform development. In addition to my current career, I will also take this as an opportunity to apply my data ETL skills to respond to a demand for accurate and actionable analytics coupled with scalable, responsive visualizations. 

## Conclusion

The beginning is always the most exciting. I will update this readme as I go through the course, and the readme will serve as a portfolio landing page for the final project, which will likely go to live on Heroku, where the rest of my projects reside. Thank you for reading, and for your interest in this repository.
